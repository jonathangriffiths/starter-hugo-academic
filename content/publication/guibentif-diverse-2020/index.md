abstract: Somite formation is foundational to creating the vertebrate segmental body
  plan. Here, we describe three transcriptional trajectories toward somite formation
  in the early mouse embryo. Precursors of the anterior-most somites ingress through
  the primitive streak before E7 and migrate anteriorly by E7.5, while a second wave
  of more posterior somites develops in the vicinity of the streak. Finally, neuromesodermal
  progenitors (NMPs) are set aside for subsequent trunk somitogenesis. Single-cell
  profiling of T−/− chimeric embryos shows that the anterior somites develop in the
  absence of T and suggests a cell-autonomous function of T as a gatekeeper between
  paraxial mesoderm production and the building of the NMP pool. Moreover, we identify
  putative regulators of early T-independent somites and challenge the T-Sox2 cross-antagonism
  model in early NMPs. Our study highlights the concept of molecular flexibility during
  early cell-type specification, with broad relevance for pluripotent stem cell differentiation
  and disease modeling.
