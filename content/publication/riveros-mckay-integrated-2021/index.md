abstract: 'Background:  There is considerable interest in whether genetic data can
  be used to improve standard cardiovascular disease risk calculators, as the latter
  are routinely used in clinical practice to manage preventative treatment.  Methods:  Using
  the UK Biobank resource, we developed our own polygenic risk score for coronary
  artery disease (CAD). We used an additional 60 000 UK Biobank individuals to develop
  an integrated risk tool (IRT) that combined our polygenic risk score with established
  risk tools (either the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology
  pooled cohort equations [PCE] or UK QRISK3), and we tested our IRT in an additional,
  independent set of 186 451 UK Biobank individuals.  Results:  The novel CAD polygenic
  risk score shows superior predictive power for CAD events, compared with other published
  polygenic risk scores, and is largely uncorrelated with PCE and QRISK3. When combined
  with PCE into an IRT, it has superior predictive accuracy. Overall, 10.4% of incident
  CAD cases were misclassified as low risk by PCE and correctly classified as high
  risk by the IRT, compared with 4.4% misclassified by the IRT and correctly classified
  by PCE. The overall net reclassification improvement for the IRT was 5.9% (95% CI,
  4.7–7.0). When individuals were stratified into age-by-sex subgroups, the improvement
  was larger for all subgroups (range, 8.3%–15.4%), with the best performance in 40-
  to 54-year-old men (15.4% [95% CI, 11.6–19.3]). Comparable results were found using
  a different risk tool (QRISK3) and also a broader definition of cardiovascular disease.
  Use of the IRT is estimated to avoid up to 12 000 deaths in the United States over
  a 5-year period.  Conclusions:  An IRT that includes polygenic risk outperforms
  current risk stratification tools and offers greater opportunity for early interventions.
  Given the plummeting costs of genetic tests, future iterations of CAD risk tools
  would be enhanced with the addition of a person’s polygenic risk.'
