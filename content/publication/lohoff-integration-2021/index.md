abstract: Molecular profiling of single cells has advanced our knowledge of the molecular
  basis of development. However, current approaches mostly rely on dissociating cells
  from tissues, thereby losing the crucial spatial context of regulatory processes.
  Here, we apply an image-based single-cell transcriptomics method, sequential fluorescence
  in situ hybridization (seqFISH), to detect mRNAs for 387 target genes in tissue
  sections of mouse embryos at the 8–12 somite stage. By integrating spatial context
  and multiplexed transcriptional measurements with two single-cell transcriptome
  atlases, we characterize cell types across the embryo and demonstrate that spatially
  resolved expression of genes not profiled by seqFISH can be imputed. We use this
  high-resolution spatial map to characterize fundamental steps in the patterning
  of the midbrain–hindbrain boundary (MHB) and the developing gut tube. We uncover
  axes of cell differentiation that are not apparent from single-cell RNA-sequencing
  (scRNA-seq) data, such as early dorsal–ventral separation of esophageal and tracheal
  progenitor populations in the gut tube. Our method provides an approach for studying
  cell fate decisions in complex tissues and development.
