I am a computational scientist motivated by solving challenging problems to positively impact human health.
I have developed deep expertise in biology, functional genomics, human genetics, and machine learning, and I like to work between these disciplines to affect the greatest possible impact.

Currently, I am working at Altos Labs in its Institute of Computation, leading a machine learning project developing large language models for epigenetics data.

During my PhD, I pioneered the first analyses of large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.
This was funded by Wellcome, and I worked at the University of Cambridge with John Marioni (now SVP, Head of Computational Sciences at Genentech).

Subsequently, I worked in the therapeutics arm of Genomics plc.
I developed deep expertise in the use of human genetic data -- and how to best combine it with functional genomics -- to identify novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
I identified novel targets, developed complete therapeutic stories, and worked with CROs to validate them.
