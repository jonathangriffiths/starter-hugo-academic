I am a computational scientist motivated by solving challenging problems to positively impact human health.
I have extensive experience across biology, genomics, statistics, and machine learning domains, both in academic and commercial settings.

Currently, I am working at Altos Labs in the BioML team, working across genetics, -omics, and machine learning/AI to build powerful models of how the genome functions.

Previously, I worked in the therapeutics arm of Genomics plc.
I applied my integrative set of skills to understand biological processes from a broad range of modern, high-throughput datasets (primarily genetic associations and genomics) to identify opportunities for therapeutic intervention, and guided the design of experiments to validate these stories.

During my PhD, I worked on methodology for analysing the first large-scale, droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing data.
I applied these methods by leasing the analysis of a landmark scRNA-seq dataset of mouse embryonic development. 
My PhD was funded by Wellcome, in the Marioni lab (Cambridge UK).
