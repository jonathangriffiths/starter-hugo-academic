I am a computational scientist motivated by solving challenging problems to positively impact human health.
I have developed deep expertise in biology, functional genomics, human genetics, and machine learning, and I like to work between these disciplines to make the biggest impact possible.

Currently, I am working at Altos Labs in the BioML team, developing foundation models of DNA sequence.

Previously, I worked in the therapeutics arm of Genomics plc.
This is where I learned about human genetics, and I use dmy interdisciplinary skills to identify novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention, and guided the design of experiments to validate these hypothesis.

During my PhD, I worked on methodology for analysing the first large-scale, droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets.
I applied these methods by leasing the analysis of a landmark scRNA-seq dataset of mouse embryonic development. 
My PhD was funded by Wellcome, in the Marioni lab.
